## Introduction

High Voltage DC is used in several applications in industries in equipments and Research. HV DC is also employed to transmit bulk power. That apart HVDC is used in testing of High Voltage Cables and as a source for charging the Impulse Voltage and Current Generator.

The most usual way of Generating High Voltage DC is through rectification using a) Half wave b) Full wave c) Multiplier Circuits. In all these cases the AC input is taken from a High Voltage transformer.
