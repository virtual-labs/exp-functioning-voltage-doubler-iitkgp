## Procedure

1. When the page gets loaded a button with value "Click to display the functioning of Voltage Doubler" is displayed.

2. The button is clicked to display the functioning of the Voltage Doubler.

3. The input parameters are Current (in &micro;A), Frequency (in Hz), Capacitance1 (in &micro;F) and Capacitance2 (in &micro;F) and these are associated with corresponding text boxes which are displayed.

4. The input values of each of these variables to be entered should be within the range specified.

5. Upon entering the values of all the variables, the Calculate Ripple button is clicked to display the computed ripple value .This calculation of ripple is for a set of values of Current (in &micro;A), Frequency (in Hz), Capacitance1 (in &micro;F) and Capacitance2 (in &micro;F).

6. In addition, the variation of one of the above parameters on the ripple voltage can also be studied.

7.The parameters that have to be varied are shown to the user on the right pane. The user clicks the corresponding parameter from the Vary parameter box.Only ONE parameter is varied while the others are kept constant during the experiment.

8. To begin the user enters the appropriate values of all the parameters and calculates the ripple as mentioned in step 5.

9. Step 5 is repeated by changing the value of the desired parameter only. The other parameters which are constant shouldnot be edited.

10. During varying, Capacitance values C1 is only varied,C2 is varied just to keep the C1/C2 ratio between 1-2 and to always maintain C1>C2

11. After calculating the ripple each time, click the Tableshow button to observe the values in a tabulated way.

12. In the"Graph Section"menu click the appropriate option to show the graph for the parameter chosen versus ripple calculated.

13. These steps can be repeated for other parameters.
